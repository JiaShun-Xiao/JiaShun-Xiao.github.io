  <p>
    I am currently a Research Scientist at the Shenzhen Institute of Big Data. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics from Southern University of Science and Technology in 2017, followed by a PhD in Mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2022. My research interests encompass statistical genetics, bioinformatics, and the development of statistical models that leverage spatial transcriptomic and multi-omics data. I am particularly focused on advancing methodologies that enhance our understanding of complex biological systems through integrative data analysis.

  <p>
    I am actively recruiting visiting students who are passionate about these fields and wish to contribute to innovative research. If you are interested in collaborating or learning more about potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out.
